This project is an AI-driven application that enhances the audio in recorded videos.   
It begins by converting the original audio to text and then fixing the text for all gramatical errors.   
Next, Amazon Polly converts these refined scripts into high-quality, natural-sounding speech.   
Finally, the corrected audio is synchronized and merged back with the original video, resulting in polished content with improved clarity and accuracy in the spoken dialogue.
